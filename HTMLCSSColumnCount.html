Prince William has sparked a new round of royal baby speculation in the British press by hinting that Prince George might have a younger brother or sister on the way very soon. 

The Duke of Cambridge set tongues wagging and computer keys clacking Saturday while greeting members of the public in the small town of Cambridge, New Zealand. When Cynthia Read, an English expatriate, presented William with a shawl commissioned by the New Zealand government for Prince George, the Duke responded by telling the 61-year-old "You might have to make another one soon!"

"The way William said it was like he was dropping a hint, letting me in on a secret," Read told The Daily Telegraph. 

The couple's official spokesman has not made any official comment on the remark, but The Telegraph reported that William and Kate have made no secret of their desire to eventually have two children.
